The city of Chicago is divided into 50 different wards. Each one of these wards are led by an elected official known as an alderman. Each month, numerous requests are made to remove graffiti in each of these wards. This is a javascript project that pulls the Api data for these wards and provides a graph to show you how many requests were made each month over the course of the year.
